## Acknowledgements
- The media (categories and episodes) is ENTIRELY listed in [osgatos.net](https://osgatos.net/), which is an amazing website not developed by me! (check out [@diogomartino](https://github.com/diogomartino/osgatos))
- This is just a simple parsing project, using Python, to scrape the website and gather the media in a more versatile player like Kodi
